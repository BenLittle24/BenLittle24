## Hello there! I'm Benjamin (Ben) Little. 

I'm a **Computer Science student** passionate about **data analysis** and **artificial intelligence**, with a knack for solving complex problems. 
I also enjoy dabbling in **game development and modifications** as a creative outlet.  

### About Me
- **Focus Areas**: Data analysis, AI, and predictive modeling.
- **What Drives Me**: For me, coding is sometimes analogous to removing a splinter—it can be frustrating and even painful, but addictive and incredibly rewarding when the problem is solved.
  Having worked in monotonous roles before, I appreciate the dynamic and versatile nature of this field, as well as the challenges that come with it.
- **How I Approach Problems**: I strive to face challenges with curiosity and confidence. As a student and early-career software developer, I’m aware of how much there is to learn, how little I’ve mastered so far, and the complexity of this field. While this can be daunting, I trust my ability to learn and adapt. When I encounter something unfamiliar, I’m confident in my ability to figure it out and find value in this process.

  That said, I’m very grateful for the modern tools and resources available that streamline this process. Working with low-level languages and assembly code has given me an appreciation for the foundational work and innovation of those who came before me, and especially the advancements that followed. 

  When approaching problems, I generally take an iterative, Agile-inspired approach. As much as I would love for my initial plans to always work, that has not been my experience thus far. After learning about Agile methodologies, I’ve embraced the principle of responding to change over following a rigid plan. This evolutionary, feedback/result driven process allows for incremental improvement and adaptation. This continuous improvement resonates with me; I find that many mistakes can offer valuable insights and improve my understanding and ability to deal with future challenges. 

- **Fun Fact**: My interest in software started when I was a teenager and discovered jailbreaking iPhones. Teaching myself through YouTube tutorials and online guides, I found the freedom to access functionality and features that weren’t widely available at the time. This sparked my interest and curiosity about software editing and eventually led me to this career path.

### Notable Projects
1. **Linear Modeling for Housing Prices**  
   - Built and evaluated a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on multiple variables. The housing data was from Cook County, Illinois, where home assessment data and processes led to regressive taxation that disproportionately impacted marginalized communities, highlighting systemic inequities. The project explored how predictive modeling could improve assessment accuracy to help mitigate these inequities, focusing on reducing the residual mean square error. 

   - Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Jupyter.

2. **NFL Moneyball Data Analysis and Visualization**  
   - Analyzed NFL performance metrics to uncover undervalued players and impactful contributions towards team success. The project involved data collection, processing, and cleaning, as well as deriving and normalizing key metrics. Interactive visualizations were designed to present insights effectively. Additionally, I experimented with HTML scraping scripts to gather salary data, which proved surprisingly difficult to acquire compared to the majority of player performance metrics.
   
   - Tools: Tableau, Excel.

3. **SIR Modeling for Disease Spread**  
   - Simulated and visualized disease spread using various modeling techniques, including matrix-based methods.  
   - Tools: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter.

3. **Game Modding: *Nanosaur***  
   - Modified game mechanics to adjust enemy spawn behaviors, overcoming challenges related to memory allocation in C. Resolved build and compatibility issues to successfully run and test the modified game.
   
   - Tools: C, Visual Studio Code, custom scripts.
  
   - ToDo: Link edited repo and original

### What I'm Working On

I’m currently preparing to start courses in **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**, which I’m very excited to explore further. I hope these courses will help me build a strong foundation in AI concepts and applications, but I’ve already started brainstorming personal projects to complement my studies. 

One idea I’m considering is a project that explores sign language recognition. I expect that the initial phase would involve using algorithms like k-Means or k-Nearest Neighbors to classify static sign language symbols in simple digital images, such as illustrated representations. As the project progresses, I’d aim to expand it to recognize symbols from static human hand images, which I anticipate will be a significant undertaking and require more advanced techniques and data preprocessing. Ultimately, the “stretch” or ambitious goal would be to develop a system capable of interpreting dynamic human hand movements in real time. Should the project reach this point, I’d think deep learning or AI driven methods would be necessary. 

While this is just an idea in its early stages, this project aligns with my interests in AI and its potential to solve meaningful and practical problems. I’m sure this project would be a heck of a splinter with its fair share of challenges, but as I said before, I appreciate the process of tackling tough problems and refining solutions.

In the meantime, I’ve been revisiting my previous projects and improving their accessibility by organizing them on GitHub. For example, I’ve been working on creating a public Tableau dashboard to showcase my NFL Moneyball project and visualizations. While the visualizations and interactions function well on my local machine, transitioning to a public Tableau server so that they can be easily shared has introduced unexpected limitations. This is definitely frustrating, but I can’t help but wonder how it can be improved.
